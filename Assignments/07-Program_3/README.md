=========

### Due: Wed Jun 21th by Classtime

### Overview

- Using the points from [HERE](../Resources/EarthquakeData/Earthquakes-1960-2017-condensed.json) run dbscan on them to discover any clusters.
- Save your cluster Minimum Bounding Rectangles to a json file to be loaded by pygame later.
- Using pygame, display each point representing an earthquake, along with the saved MBR's on your pygame screen.
