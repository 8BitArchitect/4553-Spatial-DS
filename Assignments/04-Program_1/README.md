Program 1 - Drawing Countries
=========

### Due: Tuesday Jun 13th by Classtime


### Overview

There is a starter code package [HERE](https://github.com/rugbyprof/4553-Spatial-DS/blob/master/Resources/Pygame/10-basic_geo_draw.py) that contains the following classes:

| Class Name     | Description       |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Colors         | Returns (r,g,b) tuples given a color name.   |
| StateBorders    | Returns polygons given a state name or code. Can return all states.   |
| WorldCountries  | Same as states, but for countries.    |
| DrawGeoJson     | Converts lat/lon to x,y and scales it (kind of) to a printable flat space. |
| DrawingFacade   | A helper class that makes interacting with the above classes easier . |

If you run it, it will draw a few polygons to a pygame window.
