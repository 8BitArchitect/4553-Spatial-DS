### Download Shape Files:


We will get files from this site: https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts

But just use this link for now: https://s3.amazonaws.com/metro-extracts.mapzen.com/dallas_texas.osm.bz2



### Install Postgresql (database):

> **Database**: A term used to describe software packages like Mysql and Postgresql but also confusingly used to describe separate instances within the software package. So, the "database" Mysql can contain many databases. 


```
brew install postgres
brew install postgis
brew install osm2pgsql
```

- `brew install postgres` installs the database
- `brew install osm2psql` installs an import tool to read shape files into postgres. 



Now that the database is installed, we need to setup a "template" of sorts. This is essentially a spatially enabled database that were going to use as a template for creating other databases that would need to use spatial extensions as well. It saves time so you don't have to go enable extensions every time you create a db (I think).  
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
```


```
createdb template_postgis
```

- `createdb` is a command that creates a database within Postgres. You run it from your shell and don't need to be in postgres.

Now go into postgres by typing:
```
psql
```

While in postgres:

```
# \c template_postgis
# CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis WITH SCHEMA public;
# CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
# \q
```

- `\c` kills a connection
- `template-postgis` changes to a database with this name, if it doesn't exist, it creates it.
- The `CREATE EXTENSION` commands are so this database can use the spatial extensions provided by postgres.
- `\q` quit 


#### Create DB Based on our Template:

```
createdb -T template_postgis planet_osm
```

- `createdb` same command we used to create the previous template
- `-T` says: use the following database as a template
- `planet_osm` is the name of your database



#### Load the database:

```
osm2pgsql --database=planet_osm --host=localhost dallas_texas.osm.bz2
```

#### Check out Database 

```
psql
```

```
# \c planet_osm
# \d
# \dt
```

Should result in:

```
               List of relations

#### Load Shape Files Into Graph

http://networkx.lanl.gov/reference/readwrite.nx_shp.html
http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/_downloads/networkx_reference.pdf

```
sudo pip install networkx
```

```
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G=nx.read_shp('dallas_texas_osm_roads.shp')

nodes =  G.nodes()
edges = G.edges()

print nodes[0]
print nodes[-1]

print edges[0]

```
